Let's make a platform game using pygame.
In this game we have the following types of elements:
1- The main character is controllable by the player:

It can move left and right and jump
It collects collectables and should avoid traps, projectiles and ennemies
Its objective is to recover the cup, then reach level exit
2- Static elements:
The ground is at the bottom of the screen. The player can walk on it
The platformes are floating static elements, the player can walk on them
3- Enemies:
These are AI controlled elements who seek to kill the main character and forbid him from recovering the cup and go to the exit.
Two types of enemies should be built for now:
The first is ground enemies who can't fly and can kill the main character by touching him
The second one is a space ship that drops bombs.
4- Collectables: These are elements that increase the score of the player each time they are collected
5- The cup: This is the objective of the main character
6- Level exit: A door that is only open if the player has collected the cup.
7- Traps: Holes in the ground or fire that can harm the main character and kill him.
8- The score : A digital display that represents the score of the player
9- Life: a list if hearts that represent the player remaining tries

Before coding the game, let's build the game assets list. each asset will be a png file on the same folder of the game.
Start by providing the list of asset file names that I have to provide.
