Yo, check it, we got a graph that's kinda complex,
It's 'bout the Global AI Index, let's give it some context,
Got countries lined up, different colors represent,
Each bubble's a score, you know that's what they meant.

Africa starts it off, got three bubbles in a row,
Not too high on the chart, but they still in the show,
North America's got green, you see Canada and USA,
Their bubbles are apart, but they both lead the way.

Europe's got a cluster, like a constellation of stars,
UK and Germany, they raisin' the bars,
Oceania's there with one bubble, yellow and alone,
Not too many details, but it's in the zone.

Asia's got a bunch, from Singapore to China,
Their AI game strong, ain't nothin' finer,
South Korea's blue bubble, it's chillin' with the rest,
You can see they're all striving to be the best.

South America and Middle East, they wrap it up,
Their scores are on the low, but they ain't givin' up,
The X-axis got numbers, zero to a hundo,
That's the score they're given, now you're in the know.

So that's the Global AI Index, in a rap that's tight,
Different regions, different scores, all in plain sight,
Keep this rhyme in your mind, when you look at the chart,
'Cause rap and AI together, that's a real smart art.
